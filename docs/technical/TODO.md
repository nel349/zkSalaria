# zkSalaria Implementation Todo List

**Project:** zkSalaria - ZKML-Powered Private Payroll
**Track:** Finance - Midnight Hackathon
**Timeline:** 3 weeks (Nov 2025)

---

## Phase 0: Contract Privacy & Architecture Fixes

**CRITICAL:** Current payroll.compact has privacy vulnerabilities that must be fixed before production.

### Privacy Issues to Fix

**Problem 1: Public Balances Leak Privacy**
- [x] Current: `company_balances` and `employee_balances` are public Maps on ledger
- [x] Fix: Use encrypted balance pattern from bank contract (balances encrypted on ledger)
- [x] Impact: Anyone can currently query exact salary amounts - defeats entire purpose
- [x] Solution: Adopt bank.compact's encrypted balance sharing pattern for true privacy + ownership

**Problem 2: Missing Payment History for Credit Scoring**
- [ ] Current: No payment history tracking
- [ ] Fix: Add witness for payment history: `witness employee_payment_history(employee_id) -> Vector<12, PaymentRecord>`
- [ ] Impact: ML credit scoring needs 6+ months of payment data (consistency, variance, tenure)
- [ ] Required data per payment:
  - Date/timestamp
  - Amount
  - Company ID (for verification)
  - Payment type (salary, advance, bonus)

**Problem 3: Token Flow Architecture**
- [x] Current: Minting tokens to contract's `ownPublicKey()`
- [x] Fix: Use encrypted balance pattern (bank contract's proven approach)
- [x] Decision: Encrypted ledger balances + balance mappings (Option D - Bank Pattern)
  - ‚úÖ True ownership: Employees control their encrypted balances
  - ‚úÖ Multi-party safe: Contract can update encrypted balances on ledger
  - ‚úÖ Privacy: Balances encrypted with participant keys
  - ‚úÖ Proven: Already working in bank.compact

**Problem 4: Contract Structure Needs Separation**
- [x] Current: Monolithic payroll.compact (registration + payments + tokens)
- [ ] Fix: Split into focused contracts per architecture doc:
  - [ ] `PayrollRegistry.compact` - Company/employee identity only (hashes on ledger)
  - [ ] `PrivatePayroll.compact` - Salary transfers with witnesses
  - [ ] `PayrollTokens.compact` - Keep as helper module (already done)
  - [ ] Later: `CreditScoring.compact`, `FairPayAnalysis.compact`

**Problem 5: Missing Selective Disclosure Circuits**
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_employment(employee_id, company_id) -> ZK proof` (for landlords)
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_income_range(employee_id, min, max) -> ZK proof` (for lenders)
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_payment_consistency(employee_id, threshold) -> ZK proof` (for credit)
- [ ] These enable employees to share proofs WITHOUT revealing exact amounts

### Implementation Order (Gradual)

**Step 1: Adopt Bank Contract's Encrypted Balance Pattern**
- [x] Define PaymentRecord struct in PayrollCommons.compact
- [x] Add encrypted balance ledger state (bank.compact pattern):
  ```compact
  // ENCRYPTED BALANCE SYSTEM (Bank Contract Pattern)
  export ledger encrypted_company_balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;
  export ledger encrypted_employee_balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;
  export ledger balance_mappings: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>;
  ```
- [x] Add balance encryption helpers (from bank.compact):
  - `pure circuit encrypt_balance(amount: Uint<64>, key: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32>`
  - `pure circuit generate_balance_key(participant_id, pin): Bytes<32>`
  - `pure circuit generate_simple_balance_key(participant_id): Bytes<32>` (for testing)
- [x] Keep witnesses ONLY for payment history (ZKML data):
  - `witness employee_payment_history(employee_id: Bytes<32>): Vector<12, PaymentRecord>`
  - `witness set_employee_payment_history(employee_id, history): []`
- [x] Remove old balance witnesses from index.ts (payrollWitnesses)
- [x] Update PayrollPrivateState to only store payment history

**Step 2: Migrate pay_employee Circuit to Encrypted Balance Transfer**
- [x] Update `pay_employee()` to use encrypted balances:
  1. Decrypt company balance with company key
  2. Decrypt employee balance with employee key
  3. Perform transfer: `company_bal -= amount; employee_bal += amount`
  4. Re-encrypt both balances with respective keys
  5. Update balance_mappings for decryption
  6. Append payment to employee history witness (ZKML tracking)
  7. Update public ledger: only `total_payments.increment(1)` (aggregate)
- [x] Remove PayrollTokens.compact dependency (no longer needed)
- [x] Test: Contract compiles successfully with 7 circuits

**Step 3: Update deposit_company_funds to Encrypted Balances**
- [x] Decrypt company balance (or create if new)
- [x] Mint tokens (keep real token operations)
- [x] Add deposit amount to balance
- [x] Re-encrypt balance with company key
- [x] Update balance_mappings
- [x] Update public ledger: only `total_supply` (aggregate)

**Step 4: Update withdraw_employee_salary to Encrypted Balances**
- [x] Decrypt employee balance with employee key
- [x] Verify sufficient balance
- [x] Deduct withdrawal amount
- [x] Re-encrypt balance with employee key
- [x] Update balance_mappings
- [x] Burn/transfer real tokens
- [x] Update public ledger: only `total_supply` (aggregate)

**Step 5: Add Selective Disclosure Circuits (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)**

**Overview**: Adopted bank.compact's `TransferAuthorization` pattern with shared encryption keys for selective disclosure

**üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION - ZKML Design:**

**‚ö° ZKML Usage Pattern for zkSalaria:**

```
OFF-CHAIN (Employee's Computer):
1. Read payment history from blockchain (txids)
2. Decrypt amounts with private key
3. Run ML model locally (XGBoost credit scoring) ‚Üê EZKL OFF-CHAIN
4. Generate ZK proof: "Score > 680" ‚Üê EZKL OFF-CHAIN
5. Submit proof + txids to smart contract

ON-CHAIN (Smart Contract):
1. Verify transactions exist on blockchain ‚úì
2. Verify Merkle root matches txids ‚úì
3. Verify ZK proof is valid ‚úì (NOT running ML, just verifying proof)
4. Store approval (YES/NO result)

LENDER:
1. Read approval from ledger
2. No access to payment amounts or exact score
```

**üéØ ZKML is ONLY used when:**
- Employee wants to prove something about their data WITHOUT revealing exact values
- Examples: "Score > 680", "Income in range $X-$Y", "Average salary is $Z"
- ML runs OFF-CHAIN, contract ONLY verifies proofs ON-CHAIN

**‚ùå ZKML is NOT used for:**
- Simple encrypted balance transfers (use bank.compact pattern)
- Direct salary payments (no ML needed)
- Basic CRUD operations (register, deposit, withdraw)
- Any operation that doesn't need zero-knowledge proofs

**What Contract DOES:**
- ‚úÖ Store disclosure authorizations (grant/revoke)
- ‚úÖ Verify ZK proofs from EZKL (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Track authorization expiration
- ‚úÖ Store approval results

**What Contract DOES NOT DO:**
- ‚ùå Calculate credit scores (done OFF-CHAIN with EZKL)
- ‚ùå Calculate averages (done OFF-CHAIN)
- ‚ùå Run ML models (done OFF-CHAIN)
- ‚ùå Do ANY computation on payment amounts

**Ledger State:**
- [x] Added struct `DisclosureAuthorization` in PayrollCommons.compact
- [x] Added `export ledger disclosure_authorizations: Map<Bytes<32>, DisclosureAuthorization>`
- [x] Added `export ledger shared_payment_history: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>`

**Implemented Circuits (11 total):**

**Authorization Circuits (enable ZKML, but are NOT ZKML themselves):**
- [x] `grant_income_disclosure(employee_id, lender_id, min_threshold, expires_in)`:
  - **NOT ZKML**: Simple ledger write storing authorization
  - **What it does**: Employee says "I give lender permission to see my income data"
  - **Stores**: Authorization record on public ledger with expiration
  - **Note**: This is for direct income disclosure (read payment history), NOT for credit scoring
  - **Use case**: Employee shares payment history directly with lender (no ZK proof)

- [ ] **`grant_credit_disclosure(employee_id, verifier_id, min_threshold, expires_in)` (Phase 2)**:
  - **NOT ZKML**: Simple ledger write storing authorization
  - **What it does**: Employee says "I give verifier permission to check my credit score"
  - **Stores**: Authorization record on public ledger with expiration
  - **Enables ZKML (Phase 2)**: Verifier can later request verification via `verify_credit_proof()`
  - **Future ZKML flow**:
    1. Employee grants permission: `grant_credit_disclosure()`
    2. Employee (off-chain): Runs credit model ‚Üí generates ZK proof "score > 680"
    3. Employee (on-chain): Submits proof ‚Üí stored encrypted in `encrypted_credit_scores` map
    4. Verifier (on-chain): Calls `verify_credit_proof(employee_id)` ‚Üí checks encrypted score exists and meets threshold

- [x] `grant_employment_disclosure(employee_id, verifier_id, company_id, expires_in)`:
  - **NOT ZKML**: Simple ledger write storing authorization
  - **What it does**: Employee says "I give verifier permission to verify my employment"
  - **Stores**: Authorization record on public ledger with expiration
  - **Enables ZKML (Phase 2)**: Verifier can later request ZK proof via `verify_employment_proof()`
  - **Future ZKML flow**:
    - Employee (off-chain): Generates proof "I work at company X" without revealing salary
    - Verifier (on-chain): Submits proof to `verify_employment_proof()` circuit (Phase 2)

- [x] `grant_audit_disclosure(company_id, auditor_id, expires_in)`:
  - **NOT ZKML**: Simple ledger write storing authorization
  - **What it does**: Company says "I give auditor permission to audit my payroll"
  - **Stores**: Authorization record on public ledger with expiration
  - **Enables ZKML (Phase 2)**: Auditor can download salary data, analyze, and submit comprehensive audit report
  - **Future ZKML flow**:
    - Auditor (off-chain): Downloads authorized salary data ‚Üí runs fairness analysis (ZKML) ‚Üí generates comprehensive report + ZK proof
    - Auditor (on-chain): Submits audit result via `submit_audit_result()` circuit (Phase 2)
    - Public/Regulators (on-chain): Read audit results from ledger (company passed/failed with detailed metrics)

**Other Non-ZKML Circuits:**
- [x] `revoke_disclosure(grantor_id, grantee_id, permission_type)`:
  - **NOT ZKML**: Simple ledger update (remove authorization)
  - Allows employee/company to revoke access early
  - Removes authorization from ledger
  - Removes shared payment history

**Deferred to Phase 2 (TRUE ZKML CIRCUITS - not yet implemented):**

**ZKML Architecture (following encrypted balance pattern):**

**Step 1: Authorization (NOT ZKML)**
- [ ] `grant_credit_disclosure(employee_id, verifier_id, min_threshold, expires_in)` - Employee grants permission

**Step 2: Employee Submits Encrypted Proof (ZKML CIRCUIT)**
- [ ] **`submit_credit_proof(proof, employee_wallet, txids, merkle_root, threshold, model_hash)`**:
  - ‚úÖ **THIS IS A ZKML CIRCUIT** - Employee submits ZK proof generated off-chain
  - Verifies transactions exist on blockchain
  - Verifies Merkle root consistency
  - Verifies ZK proof from EZKL is valid
  - **Stores encrypted score** in `encrypted_credit_scores` map (like encrypted_employee_balances)
  - **Stores score mapping** in `credit_score_mappings` map (like balance_mappings for decryption)
  - Employee can update their score anytime by re-submitting
  - See ZKML_TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md for full implementation

**Step 3: Verifier Checks Encrypted Score (ZKML VERIFICATION)**
- [ ] **`verify_credit_proof(employee_id, verifier_id)`**:
  - ‚úÖ **THIS IS A ZKML VERIFICATION CIRCUIT** - Third party verifies employee's credit score
  - Checks authorization: Does employee allow verifier to see score?
  - Checks encrypted score exists: Has employee submitted proof?
  - Decrypts score from `encrypted_credit_scores` + `credit_score_mappings` (if authorized)
  - Returns YES/NO based on threshold (or encrypted score if full disclosure)
  - **Does NOT re-verify ZK proof** (already verified in submit_credit_proof)

**Ledger State to Add (Phase 2):**
```compact
// Credit scores (encrypted like balances)
export ledger encrypted_credit_scores: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;     // employee_id -> encrypted_score
export ledger credit_score_mappings: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>;        // encrypted_score -> actual_score
export ledger credit_score_timestamps: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>;      // employee_id -> last_updated

// Employment proofs (encrypted like balances)
export ledger encrypted_employment_proofs: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>; // employee_id -> encrypted_proof
export ledger employment_proof_mappings: Map<Bytes<32>, Bool>;        // encrypted_proof -> is_employed

// Audit results (public/semi-public - NOT encrypted)
export ledger audit_reports: Map<Bytes<32>, AuditReport>;             // company_id -> audit_report
```

**Similar pattern for employment (encrypted proofs):**
- [ ] `grant_employment_disclosure()` - Authorization (already implemented)
- [ ] **`submit_employment_proof(proof, employee_id, company_id)`** - Employee submits encrypted employment proof (ZKML)
- [ ] **`verify_employment_proof(employee_id, verifier_id)`** - Verifier checks encrypted employment proof (ZKML VERIFICATION)

**Different pattern for audit (public/semi-public results):**
- [x] `grant_audit_disclosure()` - Authorization (already implemented)
- [ ] **`submit_audit_result(proof, company_id, auditor_id, audit_report)`** - Auditor submits comprehensive audit result (ZKML)
  - See detailed `AuditReport` structure in Phase 2 section
  - No verify circuit needed - result readable via `get_audit_result(company_id)`

**Phase 2 Implementation:**
- [ ] Employee generates ZKML credit score proof locally (EZKL + Python)
- [ ] Auditor generates ZKML fairness audit locally (EZKL + Python) with comprehensive report
- [ ] Test end-to-end: payment history ‚Üí ML ‚Üí EZKL proof ‚Üí submit ‚Üí verify/read results

**Test Scenarios:**
- [x] Test: Employee grants lender income disclosure (stores auth)
- [ ] Test: Authorization expires after time limit
- [x] Test: Employee revokes disclosure before expiration
- [ ] Test: ZKML proof generation and verification (Phase 2)
- [ ] Test: Merkle proof verification (Phase 2)
- [ ] Test: Transaction existence verification (Phase 2)

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Shared key stored on PUBLIC ledger (privacy via disclosure_id)
- ‚úÖ Automatic expiration via timestamp checks
- ‚úÖ Revocable by grantor at any time
- ‚úÖ Ready for ZKML integration (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Multi-party safe (no witness isolation issues)
- ‚úÖ Follows bank.compact proven patterns

**Compilation Status:**
- ‚úÖ 11 circuits compiling successfully

**‚ö° ZKML Classification:**

| Circuit | ZKML Usage | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `mint_tokens` | ‚ùå NO | Standard token operation |
| `register_company` | ‚ùå NO | Simple ledger write |
| `deposit_company_funds` | ‚ùå NO | Encrypted balance transfer |
| `add_employee` | ‚ùå NO | Simple ledger write |
| `withdraw_employee_salary` | ‚ùå NO | Encrypted balance transfer |
| `pay_employee` | ‚ùå NO | Encrypted balance transfer |
| `update_timestamp` | ‚ùå NO | Ledger update |
| `grant_income_disclosure` | ‚ùå NO | **Authorization only** (stores permission on ledger) |
| `grant_employment_disclosure` | ‚ùå NO | **Authorization only** (stores permission on ledger) |
| `grant_audit_disclosure` | ‚ùå NO | **Authorization only** (stores permission on ledger) |
| `revoke_disclosure` | ‚ùå NO | Simple ledger update |

**Summary:** **All 11 circuits are NON-ZKML** - They're standard encrypted operations and authorization storage. The actual ZKML circuits (`verify_credit_proof`, `verify_employment_proof`, `verify_audit_proof`) will be added in Phase 2.

**Important Architecture Notes:**
- ‚ùå **NO IN-CONTRACT COMPUTATION**: Smart contract does NOT calculate averages, scores, or run ML models
- ‚úÖ **OFF-CHAIN ML**: All ML inference happens locally on employee's computer using EZKL
- ‚úÖ **ON-CHAIN VERIFICATION**: Smart contract only verifies ZK proofs, doesn't run models
- ‚úÖ **PHASE 2 FOCUS**: Credit score verification circuit will be added in Phase 2 ZKML integration
- See **ZKML_TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md** for complete architecture and implementation details

**Step 6: Split Contracts (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] Extract PayrollRegistry.compact (registration only)
- [ ] Create PrivatePayroll.compact (payments with witnesses)
- [ ] Update imports and test integration
- [ ] Note: Can defer to post-hackathon if pressed for time

- [x] Conclusion: Tests are already optimized, no further improvements possible

**Notes:**
- ‚úÖ Followed bank-api patterns exactly (proven working implementation)
- ‚úÖ Used RxJS for reactive state management (not simple context updates)
- ‚úÖ Integrated with full Midnight SDK (not test-only implementation)
- ‚úÖ Supports both local testing (Docker) and deployed contracts
- ‚úÖ All 31 tests passing (3 integration tests + 28 smoke tests)
- ‚úÖ Test execution time: ~8 minutes for full integration suite

## Phase 2: ZKML Integration

**üö® IMPORTANT:** This phase adds ZK proof circuits (ZKML + ZK-SNARK) and LLM layer. Phase 0-1 only has authorization circuits (grant/revoke).

**Architecture - Right Tool for Each Job:**

| Use Case | Technology | Why | ZK Proof? |
|----------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Credit Scoring** | ZKML (EZKL + XGBoost) | ML model learning from patterns | ‚úÖ YES |
| **Fraud Detection** | ZKML (EZKL + Isolation Forest) | Anomaly detection, pattern recognition | ‚úÖ YES |
| **Pay Equity** | ZK-SNARK (arithmetic circuits) | Simple statistical calculations | ‚úÖ YES |
| **Tax Compliance** | ZK-SNARK (rule validation circuits) | Conditional logic, threshold checks | ‚úÖ YES |
| **Report Generation** | LLM (GPT-4, Claude) | Natural language, human-readable reports | ‚ùå NO (off-chain only) |
| **Natural Language UI** | LLM (GPT-4, Claude) | Query interface, explanations | ‚ùå NO (off-chain only) |

### ML Models (OFF-CHAIN - ZKML)
- [ ] Set up Python zkml workspace with EZKL dependencies
- [ ] **Credit Scoring Model:**
  - Build XGBoost credit scoring model with synthetic data
  - Export model to ONNX format
  - Generate ZK circuit from ONNX using EZKL
  - Create proof generation scripts (employee runs locally)
- [ ] **Fraud Detection Model:**
  - Build Isolation Forest anomaly detection model
  - Export to ONNX format
  - Generate ZK circuit using EZKL
  - Create proof generation scripts (auditor runs locally)

### ZK-SNARK Circuits (OFF-CHAIN - Arithmetic & Rule Validation)
- [ ] **Pay Equity Audit Circuits:**
  - Build ZK-SNARK circuits for statistical calculations (averages, ratios, comparisons)
  - Prove: "Average male salary = X, female salary = Y, gap = Z%"
  - Simpler than ZKML, faster proof generation
  - Use tools: Circom, SnarkJS, or Noir
- [ ] **Tax/Benefits Compliance Circuits:**
  - Build ZK-SNARK circuits for rule validation
  - Prove: "All tax withholdings match rates, X violations found"
  - Conditional logic, threshold checks
  - Use tools: Circom, SnarkJS, or Noir

### LLM Layer (OFF-CHAIN - Human Interface, NO ZK Proofs)
- [ ] **Report Generation Service:**
  - Reads structured `AuditReport` from blockchain
  - Uses LLM (GPT-4, Claude) to generate human-readable reports
  - Example: Turn findings into prose "ABC Corp's audit revealed..."
  - Output: PDF reports, email summaries, dashboard text
- [ ] **Natural Language Query Interface:**
  - User asks: "Show me all audits with critical findings in Q4"
  - LLM translates to blockchain queries
  - Returns results in natural language
- [ ] **Anomaly Explanation:**
  - User asks: "Why is employee #123's payment flagged?"
  - LLM analyzes audit findings and provides explanation
  - "This employee received duplicate payments on dates X and Y"
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance Check:**
  - LLM validates audit reports against regulations (EEOC, FLSA, etc.)
  - "This audit meets EEOC requirements for pay equity reporting"

**üîí Important:** LLM layer is OFF-CHAIN only, does NOT generate ZK proofs, used ONLY for human-readable output and natural language interface after ZK proofs are verified on-chain.

### Smart Contracts (ON-CHAIN ZK PROOF VERIFICATION)

**üö® CRITICAL: Two-Circuit Pattern (Submit + Verify)**

The ZK architecture uses TWO types of circuits following the encrypted balance pattern:

**1. Authorization Circuit (NOT ZKML):**
- [ ] `grant_credit_disclosure(employee_id, verifier_id, min_threshold, expires_in)` - Employee grants permission to verifier

**2. Submit Circuit (ZKML - Employee submits encrypted proof):**
- [ ] **`submit_credit_proof(proof, employee_wallet, txids, merkle_root, threshold, model_hash)`**
  - ‚úÖ **THIS IS A ZKML CIRCUIT** - Employee submits ZK proof they generated OFF-CHAIN
  - Employee runs EZKL locally ‚Üí generates proof "score > 680"
  - Employee calls this circuit to submit proof on-chain
  - Circuit verifies: txids exist + Merkle root + ZK proof valid
  - Circuit stores encrypted score in `encrypted_credit_scores` map (like encrypted balances)
  - **Employee controls their own encrypted score** (can update anytime)

**3. Verify Circuit (ZKML VERIFICATION - Third party checks):**
- [ ] **`verify_credit_proof(employee_id, verifier_id)`**
  - ‚úÖ **THIS IS A ZKML VERIFICATION CIRCUIT** - Third party checks employee's encrypted score
  - Checks authorization from `grant_credit_disclosure()`
  - Decrypts score from `encrypted_credit_scores` + `credit_score_mappings`
  - Returns YES/NO based on threshold
  - **Does NOT re-verify ZK proof** (already verified in submit_credit_proof)

**Similar pattern for employment:**
- [ ] `grant_employment_disclosure()` - Authorization (already implemented)
- [ ] `submit_employment_proof()` - Employee submits encrypted employment proof (ZKML)
- [ ] `verify_employment_proof()` - Verifier checks (ZKML VERIFICATION)

**Different pattern for audit (result is public/semi-public):**
- [x] `grant_audit_disclosure()` - Authorization (already implemented)
- [ ] **`submit_audit_result(proof, company_id, auditor_id, audit_report)`** - Auditor submits comprehensive audit result
  - ‚úÖ **THIS IS A ZK VERIFICATION CIRCUIT** - Auditor submits ZK proof they generated OFF-CHAIN
  - **Proof type depends on audit_type:**
    - **Fraud detection** (audit_type=3) ‚Üí Uses ZKML (EZKL) proof from ML model
    - **Pay equity** (audit_type=1) ‚Üí Uses ZK-SNARK proof from arithmetic circuits
    - **Tax compliance** (audit_type=2) ‚Üí Uses ZK-SNARK proof from rule validation circuits
  - Circuit verifies: ZK proof is valid (proves calculations/model ran correctly)
  - **Stores audit result on ledger** (public or regulator-only access)
  - **Generic audit_report structure** (supports any audit type):

## Phase 3: UI Development

- [ ] Update pay-ui to show credit scoring feature
- [ ] Build employee credit score checker UI
- [ ] **Natural Language Interface:**
  - [ ] Integrate LLM (GPT-4/Claude) for natural language queries
  - [ ] "Show me my payment history" ‚Üí LLM queries blockchain ‚Üí Returns prose
  - [ ] "Do I qualify for a loan?" ‚Üí LLM checks credit score ‚Üí Returns explanation

- [ ] **Audit Dashboard:**
  - [ ] Display structured audit findings (read from blockchain)
  - [ ] LLM-generated human-readable reports
  - [ ] Natural language explanations of irregularities
  - [ ] PDF export with LLM-generated prose

---

## Phase 4: LLM Integration (Human Interface Layer)

**üîí Important:** This phase is entirely OFF-CHAIN. LLMs do NOT generate ZK proofs, they only make blockchain data human-readable.

### Report Generation Service
- [ ] Build API service that reads AuditReport from blockchain
- [ ] Integrate LLM (OpenAI API or Claude API)
- [ ] Generate human-readable reports from structured findings
- [ ] Templates:
  - [ ] PDF audit reports for regulators
  - [ ] Email summaries for company executives
  - [ ] Dashboard cards with plain English summaries
- [ ] Example: Turn `{finding_type: 1, severity: 3, value: 230}` into "Gender pay gap of 2.3% (medium severity)"

### Natural Language Query Interface
- [ ] Build query API that translates natural language to blockchain queries
- [ ] User types: "Show me all critical audit findings from last quarter"
- [ ] LLM translates to: `filter(audit_reports, where: {overall_status: 3, timestamp: > Q3_start})`
- [ ] Returns results with LLM-generated explanations
- [ ] Conversational follow-ups: "What was the most common issue?" ‚Üí LLM analyzes findings

### Anomaly Explanation Engine
- [ ] When fraud/irregularities detected, LLM generates explanations
- [ ] Input: Structured finding `{finding_type: 10 (duplicate_payments), affected_employees: [123, 456], value: 45000}`
- [ ] Output: "Employees #123 and #456 received duplicate payments totaling $450.00 on March 15th and March 16th. This pattern suggests a payroll processing error."
- [ ] Helps auditors understand what ML models detected

### Regulatory Compliance Checker
- [ ] LLM validates audit reports against known regulations
- [ ] Input: AuditReport structure
- [ ] LLM checks against: EEOC, FLSA, IRS guidelines, state laws
- [ ] Output: "This audit meets EEOC requirements for pay equity reporting" or "Warning: Missing required FLSA overtime analysis"

**Architecture:**
```
Blockchain (structured data) ‚Üí LLM Service (off-chain) ‚Üí Human-readable output
- AuditReport (on-chain)    ‚Üí GPT-4/Claude            ‚Üí PDF reports
- Credit scores (encrypted)  ‚Üí GPT-4/Claude            ‚Üí Plain English summaries

## Future Enhancements (Priority Order for Production Payroll)

**‚ö° ZKML Usage Summary:**

| Priority | Feature | ZKML Required? | Reason |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Recurring Payments | ‚ùå NO | Simple encrypted balance transfers |
| 2 | Salary History Queries | ‚úÖ **YES** | **PRIMARY ZKML USE CASE** - Prove income without revealing amounts |
| 3 | Tax Withholding | ‚ö° HYBRID | Basic withholding = NO, W-2 privacy = YES (optional) |
| 4 | Benefits Tracking | ‚ùå NO | Simple arithmetic, optional ZKML enhancement possible |
| 5 | Payment Batching | ‚ùå NO | Performance optimization, not privacy feature |

**Key Insight:** Only 1 out of 5 enhancements requires ZKML. Most payroll operations are straightforward encrypted balance transfers. ZKML is reserved for privacy-preserving proofs where employees need to prove properties about their data without revealing exact values.

---

### Priority 1: Recurring Payments (FUNDAMENTAL)
**Why Critical:** Every company pays employees on a recurring schedule (bi-weekly, monthly, semi-monthly). Without this, companies must manually initiate every payment - not scalable for real-world use.

**‚ö° ZKML Applicability:** ‚ùå **NO ZKML NEEDED**
- Recurring payments are simple encrypted balance transfers (bank.compact pattern)
- No ML computation required
- No zero-knowledge proofs needed
- Standard ledger operations: check schedule ‚Üí execute payment ‚Üí update next_payment_date

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add `PaymentSchedule` struct in PayrollCommons.compact:
  ```compact
  struct PaymentSchedule {
    employee_id: Bytes<32>,
    amount: Uint<64>,
    frequency: Uint<8>, // 1=weekly, 2=bi-weekly, 4=monthly
    next_payment_date: Uint<64>,
    is_active: Bool
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add ledger state: `export ledger payment_schedules: Map<Bytes<32>, PaymentSchedule>`
- [ ] Create circuit: `setup_recurring_payment(employee_id, amount, frequency, start_date)`
  - Store schedule on public ledger
  - Validate company has sufficient balance
  - Set next payment date based on frequency
- [ ] Create circuit: `execute_recurring_payment(employee_id)`
  - Check if current_timestamp >= next_payment_date
  - Execute encrypted balance transfer (reuse pay_employee logic)
  - Update next_payment_date (add frequency interval)
  - Append to payment history
- [ ] Create circuit: `pause_recurring_payment(employee_id)` - Set is_active to false
- [ ] Create circuit: `resume_recurring_payment(employee_id)` - Set is_active to true
- [ ] Create circuit: `cancel_recurring_payment(employee_id)` - Remove from ledger

**User Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Companies set up payments once, run automatically forever
- ‚úÖ Employees get predictable payment schedule
- ‚úÖ Reduces manual work by 99% (no more clicking "Pay" every 2 weeks)

**Technical Notes:**
- Execution could be triggered by company, employee, or automated service
- Consider adding `last_payment_date` to track payment history
- Handle edge cases: insufficient balance (pause schedule), employee termination (cancel schedule)

---

### Priority 2: Salary History Queries with ZK Proofs (WOW FACTOR)
**Why Important:** This is zkSalaria's UNIQUE value proposition - employees can prove income to lenders/landlords without revealing exact salary amounts. This leverages the privacy architecture we've already built.

**‚ö° ZKML Applicability:** ‚úÖ **FULL ZKML IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED**
- **This is the PRIMARY ZKML use case for zkSalaria**
- **OFF-CHAIN (Employee's device)**:
  - Download payment history from blockchain (txids)
  - Decrypt amounts with private key
  - Calculate aggregate (average, threshold check, range check)
  - Run ML model if needed (credit scoring, income prediction)
  - Generate ZK proof using EZKL: "My average income is > $X" or "My score > 680"
- **ON-CHAIN (Smart contract)**:
  - Verify txids exist on blockchain
  - Verify Merkle root matches txids
  - Verify ZK proof is valid
  - Store approval (YES/NO) without revealing amounts
- **Pattern:** Exactly follows ZKML_TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md architecture
- **Integration:** Uses existing `grant_income_disclosure()` authorization circuit

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Create circuit: `generate_income_proof(employee_id, proof_type, threshold)`
  - Proof types:
    - `INCOME_ABOVE_THRESHOLD` - "I earn more than $X/month" (for credit cards)
    - `INCOME_RANGE` - "I earn between $X and $Y" (for rentals)
    - `AVERAGE_INCOME` - "My average monthly income is $X" (for loans)
  - Read payment history from ledger (already stored)
  - Calculate aggregate without revealing individual payments
  - Generate ZK proof of calculation
  - Return proof hash for verifier
- [ ] Create circuit: `verify_income_proof(proof_hash, employee_id, verifier_id)`
  - Check employee has granted disclosure to verifier
  - Verify proof is valid and not expired
  - Store verification result on ledger
  - Verifier can read YES/NO without seeing amounts
- [ ] Add ledger state: `export ledger income_proofs: Map<Bytes<32>, IncomeProof>`
- [ ] Add `IncomeProof` struct:
  ```compact
  struct IncomeProof {
    employee_id: Bytes<32>,
    proof_type: Uint<8>,
    proof_hash: Bytes<32>,
    created_at: Uint<64>,
    expires_at: Uint<64>,
    verified: Bool
  }
  ```

**User Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Employees control who sees their income data
- ‚úÖ Lenders get proof of income without salary snooping
- ‚úÖ Landlords verify tenant income privately
- ‚úÖ Banks approve loans with ZK income verification

**Integration with Existing Features:**
- ‚úÖ Leverages `grant_income_disclosure()` circuit (already implemented)
- ‚úÖ Uses payment history on public ledger (already stored)
- ‚úÖ Works with existing disclosure authorization system

**Wow Factor:**
- üöÄ "Apply for loan without revealing your exact salary"
- üöÄ "Rent apartment with privacy-preserving income proof"
- üöÄ "Get credit card approval without exposing paycheck amounts"

---

### Priority 3: Tax Withholding (LEGALLY REQUIRED)
**Why Critical:** Tax withholding is legally required in most jurisdictions. Companies must deduct federal/state/local taxes from employee paychecks and report them to tax authorities. Without this, zkSalaria cannot be used for real payroll.

**‚ö° ZKML Applicability:** ‚ö° **HYBRID - ZKML for W-2 Privacy, Standard for Withholding**
- **Tax Calculation (NO ZKML):**
  - Standard arithmetic in circuit: `tax = (amount * rate) / 100`
  - No ML needed for basic tax withholding
  - Straightforward encrypted balance operations
- **W-2 Generation (YES ZKML - OPTIONAL PRIVACY ENHANCEMENT):**
  - **OFF-CHAIN**: Employee generates ZK proof of annual tax data
  - **Proof**: "I paid $X in taxes this year" without revealing salary or individual paychecks
  - **Use Case**: Privacy-preserving tax filing (prove compliance without revealing income details)
  - **ON-CHAIN**: Contract verifies proof of annual tax totals
- **Why Hybrid?**
  - Tax withholding is computation on single paycheck (no ML needed)
  - W-2 reporting aggregates annual data (ZKML provides privacy for tax filing)
  - Employees can choose: reveal W-2 publicly OR prove via ZK proof

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add `TaxWithholding` struct in PayrollCommons.compact:
  ```compact
  struct TaxWithholding {
    employee_id: Bytes<32>,
    federal_rate: Uint<8>, // Percentage (0-100)
    state_rate: Uint<8>,
    local_rate: Uint<8>,
    additional_amount: Uint<64>, // Flat amount per paycheck
    ytd_withheld: Uint<64> // Year-to-date total
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add ledger state: `export ledger tax_withholdings: Map<Bytes<32>, TaxWithholding>`
- [ ] Create circuit: `setup_tax_withholding(employee_id, federal_rate, state_rate, local_rate, additional)`
  - Store tax configuration for employee
  - Validate rates are reasonable (0-50%)
- [ ] Update `pay_employee()` circuit to calculate and deduct taxes:
  ```compact
  gross_amount = requested_payment
  federal_tax = (gross_amount * federal_rate) / 100
  state_tax = (gross_amount * state_rate) / 100
  local_tax = (gross_amount * local_rate) / 100
  total_tax = federal_tax + state_tax + local_tax + additional_amount
  net_amount = gross_amount - total_tax

  // Transfer net_amount to employee (encrypted)
  // Keep total_tax in company reserve for tax payments
  // Update ytd_withheld
  ```
- [ ] Create circuit: `generate_w2_proof(employee_id, year)`
  - Calculate annual totals (gross income, taxes withheld)
  - Generate ZK proof of W-2 data for tax filing
  - Store proof hash on ledger
- [ ] Add to PaymentRecord:
  ```compact
  gross_amount: Uint<64>,
  tax_withheld: Uint<64>,
  net_amount: Uint<64>
  ```

**User Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Companies comply with tax laws automatically
- ‚úÖ Employees see gross vs net pay breakdown
- ‚úÖ Year-end W-2 generation (privacy-preserving)
- ‚úÖ Tax authorities can verify compliance via ZK proofs

**Technical Notes:**
- Consider adding `tax_year` to track annual limits (Social Security cap, etc.)
- Support for multiple tax jurisdictions (multi-state employees)
- Integration with IRS reporting (W-2 generation)

---

### Priority 4: Benefits Tracking (COMMON)
**Why Important:** Most companies offer benefits (health insurance, 401k, FSA, etc.) that require paycheck deductions. This is essential for competitive employers and standard in modern payroll systems.

**‚ö° ZKML Applicability:** ‚ùå **NO ZKML NEEDED (but could be enhanced)**
- **Basic Benefits Tracking (NO ZKML):**
  - Simple arithmetic: deduct benefit amount from paycheck
  - Track year-to-date contributions
  - Standard encrypted balance operations
- **OPTIONAL ZKML Enhancement (Future):**
  - **OFF-CHAIN**: Employee proves "My 401k contributions are on track for $X annual goal"
  - **OFF-CHAIN**: Employee proves "I've maxed out my HSA limit" without revealing exact amounts
  - **Use Case**: Privacy-preserving benefits planning
  - Not critical for MVP, basic tracking is sufficient

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add `BenefitDeduction` struct in PayrollCommons.compact:
  ```compact
  struct BenefitDeduction {
    employee_id: Bytes<32>,
    benefit_type: Uint<8>, // 1=health, 2=dental, 3=401k, 4=fsa, 5=hsa
    deduction_amount: Uint<64>, // Per paycheck
    company_match: Uint<64>, // Employer contribution (for 401k)
    ytd_employee: Uint<64>, // Year-to-date employee contributions
    ytd_company: Uint<64>, // Year-to-date company contributions
    is_active: Bool
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add ledger state: `export ledger benefit_deductions: Map<Bytes<32>, Vector<5, BenefitDeduction>>`
- [ ] Create circuit: `setup_benefit_deduction(employee_id, benefit_type, amount, company_match)`
  - Store benefit configuration for employee
  - Validate amounts are reasonable
- [ ] Update `pay_employee()` circuit to deduct benefits:
  ```compact
  net_after_tax = gross_amount - total_tax
  total_benefits = 0

  for each active benefit:
    deduct benefit_amount from net_after_tax
    total_benefits += benefit_amount
    if company_match > 0:
      deduct company_match from company balance
      total_benefits += company_match
    update ytd_employee and ytd_company

  final_net = net_after_tax - total_benefits
  ```
- [ ] Create circuit: `pause_benefit(employee_id, benefit_type)` - Set is_active to false
- [ ] Create circuit: `resume_benefit(employee_id, benefit_type)` - Set is_active to true
- [ ] Add to PaymentRecord:
  ```compact
  benefits_deducted: Uint<64>,
  company_match: Uint<64>
  ```

**User Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Employees see benefits deductions on paystub
- ‚úÖ Companies track employer contributions (401k match)
- ‚úÖ Year-to-date tracking for contribution limits (401k has $23,000 annual limit)
- ‚úÖ Privacy preserved (benefit elections are encrypted)

**Use Cases:**
- Health insurance: $200/month deduction
- 401k: 5% of salary with 3% company match
- HSA: $300/month pre-tax contribution
- Dental/Vision: $50/month deduction

---

### Priority 5: Payment Batching (EFFICIENCY)
**Why Important:** Paying 100+ employees one at a time is slow and expensive (gas fees, time). Batch payments allow companies to pay all employees in a single transaction, saving time and costs. Critical for larger companies.

**‚ö° ZKML Applicability:** ‚ùå **NO ZKML NEEDED**
- Batch payments are multiple encrypted balance transfers in one circuit
- No ML computation required
- No zero-knowledge proofs needed beyond standard encryption
- Performance optimization, not a privacy feature
- **Pattern**: Loop through employees ‚Üí decrypt balance ‚Üí add amount ‚Üí re-encrypt
- **Blocker**: Currently blocked by Compact loop constraints (see implementation notes)

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Create circuit: `pay_employees_batch(employee_ids: Vector<N, Bytes<32>>, amounts: Vector<N, Uint<64>>)`
  - **Challenge:** Compact doesn't support dynamic loops yet (acknowledged blocker in TODO)
  - **Workaround:** Create fixed-size batch circuits:
    - `pay_employees_batch_10()` - Pay up to 10 employees
    - `pay_employees_batch_50()` - Pay up to 50 employees
    - `pay_employees_batch_100()` - Pay up to 100 employees
  - Each circuit:
    1. Verify company has sufficient total balance
    2. For each employee (up to N):
       - Decrypt employee balance
       - Add payment amount
       - Re-encrypt employee balance
       - Update balance_mappings
       - Append to payment history
    3. Decrypt company balance once
    4. Deduct total amount from company
    5. Re-encrypt company balance once
  - Single transaction for entire batch (1 ZK proof instead of N proofs)
- [ ] Alternative: Use `pay_employees_batch_dynamic()` if Compact adds loop support
- [ ] Add ledger state for batch tracking:
  ```compact
  export ledger batch_payments: Map<Bytes<32>, BatchPaymentRecord>

  struct BatchPaymentRecord {
    batch_id: Bytes<32>,
    company_id: Bytes<32>,
    employee_count: Uint<16>,
    total_amount: Uint<64>,
    timestamp: Uint<64>
  }
  ```

**User Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Companies save time (1 transaction vs 100 transactions)
- ‚úÖ Companies save costs (1 ZK proof vs 100 proofs = ~24s vs 40 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Employees all get paid simultaneously (no staggered payments)
- ‚úÖ Audit trail shows batch payments for reconciliation

**Technical Notes:**
- **BLOCKER:** Currently blocked by Compact loop constraints (mentioned in Phase 1 checklist)
- Consider deferring to post-hackathon when Compact adds loop support
- Workaround: Fixed-size batch circuits for demonstration
- Performance: Single batch of 100 employees = 1 ZK proof (~24s) vs 100 individual payments (~40 minutes)

---

## Phase 5: Deployment & Demo

- [ ] Deploy contracts to Midnight testnet
- [ ] Deploy LLM service (report generation, natural language queries)
- [ ] Create demo with 50 employees on testnet
- [ ] Demo scenarios:
  - [ ] Credit scoring: Employee gets loan approval via ZK proof
  - [ ] Fraud detection: Auditor finds duplicate payments via ZKML
  - [ ] Pay equity: Company proves fairness via ZK-SNARK proof
  - [ ] Natural language: User asks "Show me audit findings" via LLM

---

## Phase 6: Token Vesting (Future Enhancement - Out of Scope)

**Status:** NOT IN SCOPE for current MVP
**Documentation:** See `VESTING_DESIGN.md` for complete specification
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks after MVP launch (when customers request it)

**Overview:**
Token vesting extends zkSalaria to include equity/token compensation with time-locked grants. This is separate from payroll - while payroll is "pay-as-you-go" (work ‚Üí paid), vesting is "grant-upfront" (tokens locked ‚Üí unlock over time).

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Vesting schedules with cliff periods (e.g., 12-month cliff, 48-month total)
- [ ] Linear continuous unlock or monthly chunk unlock
- [ ] Encrypted grant amounts (amounts stay private, schedules are public)
- [ ] Employee can withdraw vested tokens anytime
- [ ] Company can cancel unvested tokens if employee leaves
- [ ] Vesting timeline visualization in UI
- [ ] ZKML enhancement: Prove "I have vested tokens worth > $X" without revealing exact amount

**Smart Contracts:**
- [ ] VestingContract.compact with circuits:
  - [ ] `grant_vesting(employee_id, total_amount, cliff_months, duration_months)`
  - [ ] `calculate_vested_amount(employee_id, current_timestamp)` (pure function)
  - [ ] `withdraw_vested(employee_id, amount)`
  - [ ] `cancel_vesting(employee_id)` (company only)
  - [ ] `accelerate_vesting(employee_id, new_schedule)` (for acquisitions)
- [ ] Add vesting ledger state:
  - `vesting_schedules: Map<Bytes<32>, VestingGrant>`
  - `vesting_withdrawn_amounts: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>`
  - `vesting_cancelled: Map<Bytes<32>, Bool>`

**API Layer:**
- [ ] Create vesting-api package (following payroll-api patterns)
- [ ] VestingAPI class with RxJS reactive state
- [ ] Methods: grantVesting(), getVestingSchedule(), withdrawVested(), cancelVesting()

**UI Development:**
- [ ] Add "Vesting" tab to company dashboard (separate from Payroll)
- [ ] Add "My Vesting" tab to employee dashboard (separate from My Salary)
- [ ] Grant vesting modal with schedule preview
- [ ] Vesting timeline visualization (interactive chart showing unlock progress)
- [ ] Withdraw vested tokens modal with available balance

**Why Defer to Phase 6:**
- ‚úÖ Focus on payroll first (core value prop)
- ‚úÖ ZKML integration more valuable than vesting for MVP
- ‚úÖ Sablier already exists for public vesting (we differentiate with payroll + ZKML)
- ‚úÖ Build vesting ONLY when customers explicitly request it

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **Sablier:** Public vesting (all amounts visible)
- **zkSalaria Phase 6:** Private vesting (encrypted amounts, ZK proofs)
- **Value Prop:** "The only private compensation platform: salary + equity, all encrypted"

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 1 - Testing & Validation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Current Task:** Ready to move to Phase 2 - API Integration OR ZKML Integration
**Last Update:** December 2024 - Balance decryption testing completed with multi-party architecture

**‚ö° ZKML Architecture Overview:**

**Current Implementation (Phase 0-1):**
- ‚úÖ **11 NON-ZKML circuits** - All current circuits are standard operations:
  - 7 encrypted balance operations (deposit, pay, withdraw, register, mint, update_timestamp)
  - 3 authorization circuits (grant_income_disclosure, grant_employment_disclosure, grant_audit_disclosure)
  - 1 revoke circuit (revoke_disclosure)
- ‚úÖ **Payment history on public ledger** - Accessible for off-chain ZKML credit scoring
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **ZKML verification circuits** - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (Phase 2)
  - `verify_credit_proof()` - Verify ZK proof of credit score
  - `verify_employment_proof()` - Verify ZK proof of employment
  - `verify_audit_proof()` - Verify ZK proof of fair pay analysis

**ZKML Pattern (Phase 2 - Two-Circuit Architecture):**
```
1. Authorization (Phase 0-1 - CURRENT):
   Employee calls grant_credit_disclosure() ‚Üí Store permission on ledger ‚Üí NOT ZKML

2. OFF-CHAIN (Employee's device - Phase 2):
   Employee: Download payment txids ‚Üí Decrypt amounts ‚Üí Run EZKL locally ‚Üí Generate ZK proof

3. ON-CHAIN SUBMIT (Phase 2 - ZKML CIRCUIT):
   Employee calls submit_credit_proof() ‚Üí Verify proof + txids ‚Üí Store encrypted score on ledger
   ‚Üë THIS IS A ZKML CIRCUIT (verifies ZK proof from EZKL)

4. ON-CHAIN VERIFY (Phase 2 - ZKML VERIFICATION CIRCUIT):
   Third party calls verify_credit_proof(employee_id) ‚Üí Check authorization ‚Üí Decrypt score ‚Üí Return YES/NO
   ‚Üë THIS IS A ZKML VERIFICATION CIRCUIT (checks encrypted score)
```

**Key Insight:**
- **grant circuits** = Authorization (just permission storage, NOT ZKML)
- **submit circuits** = Employee submits encrypted proof (ZKML - verifies ZK proof)
- **verify circuits** = Third party checks encrypted score (ZKML VERIFICATION - decrypts if authorized)
- Follows encrypted balance pattern: `encrypted_credit_scores` + `credit_score_mappings`

**‚úÖ What Works Now:**
- ‚úÖ Payroll contract with 11 NON-ZKML circuits (register, deposit, pay, withdraw, authorization)
- ‚úÖ Encrypted balance system (encrypted_employee_balances + balance_mappings)
- ‚úÖ Real token operations (mint, send via Midnight blockchain)
- ‚úÖ Payment history on public ledger (ready for ZKML credit scoring in Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Authorization circuits for selective disclosure (grant/revoke permissions)
- ‚úÖ Multi-party architecture tested (separate private states per participant)
- ‚úÖ Balance decryption verified (22 comprehensive tests passing)
- ‚úÖ **ZKML foundation ready**: Authorization + payment history in place, ZKML verification circuits deferred to Phase 2

**üîÑ Next Steps - Three-Layer Architecture:**
1. **ZK Proof Layer (Phase 2)** - Build proof generation:
   - ZKML (EZKL) for credit scoring, fraud detection
   - ZK-SNARK for pay equity, tax compliance
2. **Smart Contract Layer (Phase 2)** - Add verification circuits:
   - submit_credit_proof(), verify_credit_proof()
   - submit_audit_result(), get_audit_result()
3. **LLM Layer (Phase 4)** - Human interface:
   - Report generation (GPT-4/Claude)
   - Natural language queries
   - Anomaly explanations
4. **UI Layer (Phase 3)** - Build React frontend with LLM integration

- ‚úÖ Multi-party testing completed:
  - **22 comprehensive multi-party tests passing** (single-party tests deprecated)
  - ‚úÖ Verified separate private states per participant (company, employee, verifier)
  - ‚úÖ Verified encrypted balance transfers work correctly across participants
  - ‚úÖ Verified payment history isolation per employee on shared public ledger
  - ‚úÖ **Balance decryption from ledger tested** (7 new tests):

  - Actual balance decryption from ledger (encrypted_employee_balances ‚Üí balance_mappings)
  - Both match, proving encryption logic works correctly
  - Company balance = token_reserve (not separately encrypted)
  - Employee balances encrypted with independent keys
- ‚úÖ **Deprecated single-party tests**:

  - Midnight SDK providers setup (wallet, indexer, proof)
  - Docker test environment (midnight-node, indexer, proof-server)
  - Comprehensive integration tests
  - End-to-end testing: deploy ‚Üí mint ‚Üí register ‚Üí deposit ‚Üí add employee ‚Üí pay ‚Üí withdraw
- Note: Expect ~24s per transaction (15s ZK proof + 9s block confirmation)

**Next Steps (Choose One Path):**

**Option A: API Layer Development** (Recommended - bridges contract to UI)
- Create payroll-api package following @midnight-bank/bank-api patterns
- Implement PayrollAPI class with RxJS reactive state management
- Set up Midnight SDK providers (wallet, indexer, proof)

- Write integration tests for all circuits
- Document: Transaction times (~24s per tx due to ZK proofs)

**Option B: ZKML Integration** (Phase 2 - see detailed checklist in Phase 2 section)
- Set up Python zkml workspace with EZKL dependencies
- Build XGBoost credit scoring model with synthetic payment data
- Export model to ONNX format
- Generate ZK circuit from ONNX using EZKL
- Create CreditScoring.compact for ZKML proof verification

## Architectural Decision: Encrypted Ledger vs Witnesses

**Date:** Nov 2025
**Decision:** Use bank.compact's encrypted balance pattern with payment history on public ledger

**Why the change?**
- Original plan: Store balances AND payment history in witnesses (private local storage)
- Problem discovered: Witnesses are local to each participant - company circuit can't update employee's witness
- Solution discovered: Bank contract uses encrypted balances on PUBLIC ledger
  - Balances encrypted with participant keys
  - Contract can update any participant's encrypted balance
  - True token ownership (not just company IOU)
  - Proven pattern (already working in bank.compact)

**What's on PUBLIC LEDGER?**
- Company balances (ENCRYPTED with company key)
- Employee balances (ENCRYPTED with employee key)
- Balance mappings (encrypted_balance ‚Üí actual_amount)
- Payment history (ON LEDGER - for ZKML accessibility)
  - `export ledger employee_payment_history: Map<Bytes<32>, Vector<12, PaymentRecord>>`
  - Company can write when paying employee
  - Anyone can read for credit scoring (intentional for ZKML)

**What stays in witnesses?**
- NOTHING (all removed)
- Payment history moved to public ledger following bank.compact pattern
- Private states are now empty (no witness functions needed)

**Benefits:**
1. ‚úÖ Solves multi-party state update problem
2. ‚úÖ True ownership (employee controls encrypted balance)
3. ‚úÖ Privacy preserved for balances (encryption prevents blockchain snooping)
4. ‚úÖ ZKML accessibility (payment history readable for credit scoring)
5. ‚úÖ Enables authorization system (like bank's disclosure permissions)
6. ‚úÖ Proven architecture (reuses bank.compact patterns)
