# zkSalaria Implementation Todo List

**Project:** zkSalaria - ZKML-Powered Private Payroll
**Track:** Finance - Midnight Hackathon
**Timeline:** 3 weeks (Nov 2025)

## Phase 0: Contract Privacy & Architecture Fixes

**CRITICAL:** Current payroll.compact has privacy vulnerabilities that must be fixed before production.

### Privacy Issues to Fix

**Problem 1: Public Balances Leak Privacy**
- [x] Current: `company_balances` and `employee_balances` are public Maps on ledger
- [x] Fix: Use encrypted balance pattern from bank contract (balances encrypted on ledger)
- [x] Impact: Anyone can currently query exact salary amounts - defeats entire purpose
- [x] Solution: Adopt bank.compact's encrypted balance sharing pattern for true privacy + ownership

**Problem 2: Missing Payment History for Credit Scoring**
- [ ] Current: No payment history tracking
- [ ] Fix: Add witness for payment history: `witness employee_payment_history(employee_id) -> Vector<12, PaymentRecord>`
- [ ] Impact: ML credit scoring needs 6+ months of payment data (consistency, variance, tenure)
- [ ] Required data per payment:
  - Date/timestamp
  - Amount
  - Company ID (for verification)
  - Payment type (salary, advance, bonus)

**Problem 3: Token Flow Architecture**
- [x] Current: Minting tokens to contract's `ownPublicKey()`
- [x] Fix: Use encrypted balance pattern (bank contract's proven approach)
- [x] Decision: Encrypted ledger balances + balance mappings (Option D - Bank Pattern)
  - ‚úÖ True ownership: Employees control their encrypted balances
  - ‚úÖ Multi-party safe: Contract can update encrypted balances on ledger
  - ‚úÖ Privacy: Balances encrypted with participant keys
  - ‚úÖ Proven: Already working in bank.compact

**Problem 4: Contract Structure Needs Separation**
- [x] Current: Monolithic payroll.compact (registration + payments + tokens)
- [ ] Fix: Split into focused contracts per architecture doc:
  - [ ] `PayrollRegistry.compact` - Company/employee identity only (hashes on ledger)
  - [ ] `PrivatePayroll.compact` - Salary transfers with witnesses
  - [ ] `PayrollTokens.compact` - Keep as helper module (already done)
  - [ ] Later: `CreditScoring.compact`, `FairPayAnalysis.compact`

**Problem 5: Missing Selective Disclosure Circuits**
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_employment(employee_id, company_id) -> ZK proof` (for landlords)
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_income_range(employee_id, min, max) -> ZK proof` (for lenders)
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_payment_consistency(employee_id, threshold) -> ZK proof` (for credit)
- [ ] These enable employees to share proofs WITHOUT revealing exact amounts

### Implementation Order (Gradual)

**Step 1: Adopt Bank Contract's Encrypted Balance Pattern**
- [x] Define PaymentRecord struct in PayrollCommons.compact
- [x] Add encrypted balance ledger state (bank.compact pattern):
  ```compact
  // ENCRYPTED BALANCE SYSTEM (Bank Contract Pattern)
  export ledger encrypted_company_balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;
  export ledger encrypted_employee_balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;
  export ledger balance_mappings: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>;
  ```
- [x] Add balance encryption helpers (from bank.compact):
  - `pure circuit encrypt_balance(amount: Uint<64>, key: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32>`
  - `pure circuit generate_balance_key(participant_id, pin): Bytes<32>`
  - `pure circuit generate_simple_balance_key(participant_id): Bytes<32>` (for testing)
- [x] Keep witnesses ONLY for payment history (ZKML data):
  - `witness employee_payment_history(employee_id: Bytes<32>): Vector<12, PaymentRecord>`
  - `witness set_employee_payment_history(employee_id, history): []`
- [x] Remove old balance witnesses from index.ts (payrollWitnesses)
- [x] Update PayrollPrivateState to only store payment history

**Step 2: Migrate pay_employee Circuit to Encrypted Balance Transfer**
- [x] Update `pay_employee()` to use encrypted balances:
  1. Decrypt company balance with company key
  2. Decrypt employee balance with employee key
  3. Perform transfer: `company_bal -= amount; employee_bal += amount`
  4. Re-encrypt both balances with respective keys
  5. Update balance_mappings for decryption
  6. Append payment to employee history witness (ZKML tracking)
  7. Update public ledger: only `total_payments.increment(1)` (aggregate)
- [x] Remove PayrollTokens.compact dependency (no longer needed)
- [x] Test: Contract compiles successfully with 7 circuits

**Step 3: Update deposit_company_funds to Encrypted Balances**
- [x] Decrypt company balance (or create if new)
- [x] Mint tokens (keep real token operations)
- [x] Add deposit amount to balance
- [x] Re-encrypt balance with company key
- [x] Update balance_mappings
- [x] Update public ledger: only `total_supply` (aggregate)

**Step 4: Update withdraw_employee_salary to Encrypted Balances**
- [x] Decrypt employee balance with employee key
- [x] Verify sufficient balance
- [x] Deduct withdrawal amount
- [x] Re-encrypt balance with employee key
- [x] Update balance_mappings
- [x] Burn/transfer real tokens
- [x] Update public ledger: only `total_supply` (aggregate)

**Step 5: Add Selective Disclosure Circuits (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)**

**Overview**: Adopted bank.compact's `TransferAuthorization` pattern with shared encryption keys for selective disclosure

**üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION - ZKML Design:**

```
OFF-CHAIN (Employee's Computer):
1. Read payment history from blockchain (txids)
2. Decrypt amounts with private key
3. Run ML model locally (XGBoost credit scoring) ‚Üê EZKL
4. Generate ZK proof: "Score > 680" ‚Üê EZKL
5. Submit proof + txids to smart contract

ON-CHAIN (Smart Contract):
1. Verify transactions exist on blockchain ‚úì
2. Verify Merkle root matches txids ‚úì
3. Verify ZK proof is valid ‚úì
4. Store approval (YES/NO result)

LENDER:
1. Read approval from ledger
2. No access to payment amounts or exact score
```

**What Contract DOES:**
- ‚úÖ Store disclosure authorizations (grant/revoke)
- ‚úÖ Verify ZK proofs from EZKL (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Track authorization expiration
- ‚úÖ Store approval results

**What Contract DOES NOT DO:**
- ‚ùå Calculate credit scores (done OFF-CHAIN with EZKL)
- ‚ùå Calculate averages (done OFF-CHAIN)
- ‚ùå Run ML models (done OFF-CHAIN)
- ‚ùå Do ANY computation on payment amounts

**Ledger State:**
- [x] Added struct `DisclosureAuthorization` in PayrollCommons.compact
- [x] Added `export ledger disclosure_authorizations: Map<Bytes<32>, DisclosureAuthorization>`
- [x] Added `export ledger shared_payment_history: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>`

**Implemented Circuits (11 total):**
- [x] `grant_income_disclosure(employee_id, lender_id, min_threshold, expires_in)`:
  - Stores authorization on ledger
  - Grants lender permission to submit ZKML proofs
  - NOTE: Actual credit score calculation happens OFF-CHAIN (EZKL in Phase 2)

- [x] `grant_employment_disclosure(employee_id, verifier_id, company_id, expires_in)`:
  - Stores authorization for employment verification
  - Landlord/verifier can submit ZKML proofs to verify employment
  - Company ID validated but stored separately (threshold not used)

- [x] `grant_audit_disclosure(company_id, auditor_id, expires_in)`:
  - Stores authorization for compliance/pay equity audits
  - Auditor can submit ZKML proofs for fairness analysis
  - Company grants permission for aggregate analysis

- [x] `revoke_disclosure(grantor_id, grantee_id, permission_type)`:
  - Allows employee/company to revoke access early
  - Removes authorization from ledger
  - Removes shared payment history

**Deferred to Phase 2 (ZKML Integration):**
- [ ] `verify_credit_proof(proof, employee_wallet, txids, merkle_root, threshold, model_hash)`:
  - Verifies transactions exist on blockchain
  - Verifies Merkle root consistency
  - Verifies ZK proof from EZKL
  - Stores approval result
  - See ZKML_TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md for full implementation

- [ ] Employee generates ZKML credit score proof locally (EZKL + Python)
- [ ] Test end-to-end: payment history ‚Üí ML ‚Üí EZKL proof ‚Üí verification

**Test Scenarios:**
- [x] Test: Employee grants lender income disclosure (stores auth)
- [ ] Test: Authorization expires after time limit
- [x] Test: Employee revokes disclosure before expiration
- [ ] Test: ZKML proof generation and verification (Phase 2)
- [ ] Test: Merkle proof verification (Phase 2)
- [ ] Test: Transaction existence verification (Phase 2)

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Shared key stored on PUBLIC ledger (privacy via disclosure_id)
- ‚úÖ Automatic expiration via timestamp checks
- ‚úÖ Revocable by grantor at any time
- ‚úÖ Ready for ZKML integration (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Multi-party safe (no witness isolation issues)
- ‚úÖ Follows bank.compact proven patterns

**Compilation Status:**
- ‚úÖ 11 circuits compiling successfully:
  1. mint_tokens
  2. register_company
  3. deposit_company_funds
  4. add_employee
  5. withdraw_employee_salary
  6. pay_employee
  7. update_timestamp
  8. **grant_income_disclosure** ‚Üê NEW (Phase 0 Step 5)
  9. **grant_employment_disclosure** ‚Üê NEW (Phase 0 Step 5)
  10. **grant_audit_disclosure** ‚Üê NEW (Phase 0 Step 5)
  11. **revoke_disclosure** ‚Üê NEW (Phase 0 Step 5)

**Important Architecture Notes:**
- ‚ùå **NO IN-CONTRACT COMPUTATION**: Smart contract does NOT calculate averages, scores, or run ML models
- ‚úÖ **OFF-CHAIN ML**: All ML inference happens locally on employee's computer using EZKL
- ‚úÖ **ON-CHAIN VERIFICATION**: Smart contract only verifies ZK proofs, doesn't run models
- ‚úÖ **PHASE 2 FOCUS**: Credit score verification circuit will be added in Phase 2 ZKML integration
- See **ZKML_TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md** for complete architecture and implementation details

**Step 6: Split Contracts (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] Extract PayrollRegistry.compact (registration only)
- [ ] Create PrivatePayroll.compact (payments with witnesses)
- [ ] Update imports and test integration
- [ ] Note: Can defer to post-hackathon if pressed for time

## Architectural Decision: Encrypted Ledger vs Witnesses

**Date:** Nov 2025
**Decision:** Use bank.compact's encrypted balance pattern with payment history on public ledger

**Why the change?**
- Original plan: Store balances AND payment history in witnesses (private local storage)
- Problem discovered: Witnesses are local to each participant - company circuit can't update employee's witness
- Solution discovered: Bank contract uses encrypted balances on PUBLIC ledger
  - Balances encrypted with participant keys
  - Contract can update any participant's encrypted balance
  - True token ownership (not just company IOU)
  - Proven pattern (already working in bank.compact)

**What's on PUBLIC LEDGER?**
- Company balances (ENCRYPTED with company key)
- Employee balances (ENCRYPTED with employee key)
- Balance mappings (encrypted_balance ‚Üí actual_amount)
- Payment history (ON LEDGER - for ZKML accessibility)
  - `export ledger employee_payment_history: Map<Bytes<32>, Vector<12, PaymentRecord>>`
  - Company can write when paying employee
  - Anyone can read for credit scoring (intentional for ZKML)

**What stays in witnesses?**
- NOTHING (all removed)
- Payment history moved to public ledger following bank.compact pattern
- Private states are now empty (no witness functions needed)

**Benefits:**
1. ‚úÖ Solves multi-party state update problem
2. ‚úÖ True ownership (employee controls encrypted balance)
3. ‚úÖ Privacy preserved for balances (encryption prevents blockchain snooping)
4. ‚úÖ ZKML accessibility (payment history readable for credit scoring)
5. ‚úÖ Enables authorization system (like bank's disclosure permissions)
6. ‚úÖ Proven architecture (reuses bank.compact patterns)
