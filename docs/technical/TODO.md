# zkSalaria Implementation Todo List

**Project:** zkSalaria - ZKML-Powered Private Payroll
**Track:** Finance - Midnight Hackathon
**Timeline:** 3 weeks (Nov 2025)

## Phase 0: Contract Privacy & Architecture Fixes

**CRITICAL:** Current payroll.compact has privacy vulnerabilities that must be fixed before production.

### Privacy Issues to Fix

**Problem 1: Public Balances Leak Privacy**
- [x] Current: `company_balances` and `employee_balances` are public Maps on ledger
- [x] Fix: Use encrypted balance pattern from bank contract (balances encrypted on ledger)
- [x] Impact: Anyone can currently query exact salary amounts - defeats entire purpose
- [x] Solution: Adopt bank.compact's encrypted balance sharing pattern for true privacy + ownership

**Problem 2: Missing Payment History for Credit Scoring**
- [ ] Current: No payment history tracking
- [ ] Fix: Add witness for payment history: `witness employee_payment_history(employee_id) -> Vector<12, PaymentRecord>`
- [ ] Impact: ML credit scoring needs 6+ months of payment data (consistency, variance, tenure)
- [ ] Required data per payment:
  - Date/timestamp
  - Amount
  - Company ID (for verification)
  - Payment type (salary, advance, bonus)

**Problem 3: Token Flow Architecture**
- [x] Current: Minting tokens to contract's `ownPublicKey()`
- [x] Fix: Use encrypted balance pattern (bank contract's proven approach)
- [x] Decision: Encrypted ledger balances + balance mappings (Option D - Bank Pattern)
  - ✅ True ownership: Employees control their encrypted balances
  - ✅ Multi-party safe: Contract can update encrypted balances on ledger
  - ✅ Privacy: Balances encrypted with participant keys
  - ✅ Proven: Already working in bank.compact

**Problem 4: Contract Structure Needs Separation**
- [x] Current: Monolithic payroll.compact (registration + payments + tokens)
- [ ] Fix: Split into focused contracts per architecture doc:
  - [ ] `PayrollRegistry.compact` - Company/employee identity only (hashes on ledger)
  - [ ] `PrivatePayroll.compact` - Salary transfers with witnesses
  - [ ] `PayrollTokens.compact` - Keep as helper module (already done)
  - [ ] Later: `CreditScoring.compact`, `FairPayAnalysis.compact`

**Problem 5: Missing Selective Disclosure Circuits**
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_employment(employee_id, company_id) -> ZK proof` (for landlords)
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_income_range(employee_id, min, max) -> ZK proof` (for lenders)
- [ ] Add circuit: `prove_payment_consistency(employee_id, threshold) -> ZK proof` (for credit)
- [ ] These enable employees to share proofs WITHOUT revealing exact amounts

### Implementation Order (Gradual)

**Step 1: Adopt Bank Contract's Encrypted Balance Pattern**
- [x] Define PaymentRecord struct in PayrollCommons.compact
- [x] Add encrypted balance ledger state (bank.compact pattern):
  ```compact
  // ENCRYPTED BALANCE SYSTEM (Bank Contract Pattern)
  export ledger encrypted_company_balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;
  export ledger encrypted_employee_balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Bytes<32>>;
  export ledger balance_mappings: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>;
  ```
- [x] Add balance encryption helpers (from bank.compact):
  - `pure circuit encrypt_balance(amount: Uint<64>, key: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32>`
  - `pure circuit generate_balance_key(participant_id, pin): Bytes<32>`
  - `pure circuit generate_simple_balance_key(participant_id): Bytes<32>` (for testing)
- [x] Keep witnesses ONLY for payment history (ZKML data):
  - `witness employee_payment_history(employee_id: Bytes<32>): Vector<12, PaymentRecord>`
  - `witness set_employee_payment_history(employee_id, history): []`
- [x] Remove old balance witnesses from index.ts (payrollWitnesses)
- [x] Update PayrollPrivateState to only store payment history

**Step 2: Migrate pay_employee Circuit to Encrypted Balance Transfer**
- [x] Update `pay_employee()` to use encrypted balances:
  1. Decrypt company balance with company key
  2. Decrypt employee balance with employee key
  3. Perform transfer: `company_bal -= amount; employee_bal += amount`
  4. Re-encrypt both balances with respective keys
  5. Update balance_mappings for decryption
  6. Append payment to employee history witness (ZKML tracking)
  7. Update public ledger: only `total_payments.increment(1)` (aggregate)
- [x] Remove PayrollTokens.compact dependency (no longer needed)
- [x] Test: Contract compiles successfully with 7 circuits

**Step 3: Update deposit_company_funds to Encrypted Balances**
- [x] Decrypt company balance (or create if new)
- [x] Mint tokens (keep real token operations)
- [x] Add deposit amount to balance
- [x] Re-encrypt balance with company key
- [x] Update balance_mappings
- [x] Update public ledger: only `total_supply` (aggregate)

**Step 4: Update withdraw_employee_salary to Encrypted Balances**
- [x] Decrypt employee balance with employee key
- [x] Verify sufficient balance
- [x] Deduct withdrawal amount
- [x] Re-encrypt balance with employee key
- [x] Update balance_mappings
- [x] Burn/transfer real tokens
- [x] Update public ledger: only `total_supply` (aggregate)

**Step 5: Add Selective Disclosure Circuits**
- [ ] Implement `prove_employment()` - Proves employment without revealing salary
- [ ] Implement `prove_income_range()` - Proves income within range without exact amount
- [ ] Implement `prove_payment_consistency()` - Proves regular payments without amounts
- [ ] Test with external verifier (mock landlord/lender)

**Step 6: Split Contracts (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] Extract PayrollRegistry.compact (registration only)
- [ ] Create PrivatePayroll.compact (payments with witnesses)
- [ ] Update imports and test integration
- [ ] Note: Can defer to post-hackathon if pressed for time

## Phase 1: Core Payroll Infrastructure

### Smart Contracts - Current Status
- [x] Read and understand existing pay.compact contract structure
- [x] Create minimal payroll.compact that compiles (needs privacy fixes - see Phase 0)
- [x] Add company registration circuit
- [x] Add employee registration circuit
- [x] Add single salary payment circuit (needs witness migration - see Phase 0)
- [x] Integrate real Midnight token operations (mint/burn)
- [x] Run npm run compile - 7 circuits compiling successfully
- [ ] Create PayrollCommons.compact with zkSalaria-specific types (PaymentRecord struct)
- [ ] Add batch payment processing for multiple employees (blocked by Compact loop constraints)
- [ ] Complete Phase 0 privacy fixes before proceeding

### API Layer
- [ ] Update pay-api to work with new payroll contracts
- [ ] Test private payroll with local deployment

## Phase 2: ZKML Integration

### ML Models
- [ ] Set up Python zkml workspace with EZKL dependencies
- [ ] Build XGBoost credit scoring model with synthetic data
- [ ] Export model to ONNX format
- [ ] Generate ZK circuit from ONNX using EZKL

### Smart Contracts
- [ ] Create CreditScoring.compact for ZKML proof verification
- [ ] Integrate ZKML proof generation with payroll-api
- [ ] Test end-to-end: payment → ML analysis → proof → verification

## Architectural Decision: Encrypted Ledger vs Witnesses

**Date:** Nov 2025
**Decision:** Use bank.compact's encrypted balance pattern instead of witness-only approach

**Why the change?**
- Original plan: Store balances in witnesses (private local storage)
- Problem: Witnesses are local to each participant - company circuit can't update employee's witness
- Solution discovered: Bank contract uses encrypted balances on PUBLIC ledger
  - Balances encrypted with participant keys
  - Contract can update any participant's encrypted balance
  - True token ownership (not just company IOU)
  - Proven pattern (already working in bank.compact)

**What stays in witnesses?**
- Payment history for ZKML (Vector<12, PaymentRecord>)
- This data is for ML training only, not for transfers
- Employee controls their payment history locally

**What moves to encrypted ledger?**
- Company balances (encrypted with company key)
- Employee balances (encrypted with employee key)
- Balance mappings (encrypted_balance → actual_amount)

**Benefits:**
1. ✅ Solves multi-party state update problem
2. ✅ True ownership (employee controls encrypted balance)
3. ✅ Privacy preserved (encryption prevents blockchain snooping)
4. ✅ Enables authorization system (like bank's disclosure permissions)
5. ✅ Proven architecture (reuses bank.compact patterns)
