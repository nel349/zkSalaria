## The Core Problem

### What ZKML Needs to Prove

When an employee generates a credit score using zkSalaria, we need to prove TWO things:

1. **Model Correctness:** The computation was done using the correct ML model
2. **Data Correctness:** The input data was real (from actual blockchain payments)

**Traditional ZK proofs** only solve #1. **zkSalaria's innovation** is solving both cryptographically.

---

## ZKML Flow: Step-by-Step

### Example: Alice Needs a $2,000 Payroll Advance

#### Step 1: Local Computation (Alice's Computer)

```
Alice's private data:
- Payment txid: 0xTX001 → Amount: $7,500 (decrypted from Midnight)
- Payment txid: 0xTX002 → Amount: $7,500
- Payment txid: 0xTX003 → Amount: $7,200
- Payment txid: 0xTX004 → Amount: $7,800
- Payment txid: 0xTX005 → Amount: $7,500
- Payment txid: 0xTX006 → Amount: $7,500

ML Model runs locally:
Input: [7500, 7500, 7200, 7800, 7500, 7500]
↓ XGBoost Credit Scoring Model
↓
Output: Credit Score = 745

Nothing leaves Alice's computer yet.
Alice now knows her score (745), but no one else does.
```

---

#### Step 2: Generate ZK Proof (Alice's Computer)

**Alice wants to prove a CLAIM:**
> "My credit score is greater than 680"

**What goes into the ZK circuit:**

**Private Inputs (Witness - hidden from verifier):**
- Payment amounts: [7500, 7500, 7200, 7800, 7500, 7500] ← SECRET
- ML model weights (XGBoost parameters) ← SECRET
- Actual credit score: 745 ← SECRET
- Alice's private key (to decrypt transaction amounts) ← SECRET

**Public Inputs (visible to verifier):**
- Transaction IDs: [0xTX001, 0xTX002, 0xTX003, 0xTX004, 0xTX005, 0xTX006]
- Merkle root: 0xMerkleRoot123 (commitment to these txids)
- Threshold: 680
- Model hash: 0xModelABC (identifies which ML model)
- Alice's wallet address: 0xAlice

**What the ZK circuit proves:**
```
"I executed ML model 0xModelABC on payment amounts
decrypted from transactions [0xTX001, 0xTX002, ...],
and the output was a number greater than 680.

I'm not telling you:
- What the exact score is (745)
- What the payment amounts are
- Any other financial details

But I'm cryptographically proving this statement is TRUE."
```

**Output of proof generation:**
```javascript
proof = {
  zkproof: 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f... (cryptographic proof, 256-512 bytes),
  public_inputs: {
    txids: [0xTX001, 0xTX002, 0xTX003, 0xTX004, 0xTX005, 0xTX006],
    merkle_root: 0xMerkleRoot123,
    threshold: 680,
    model_hash: 0xModelABC,
    employee_wallet: 0xAlice
  }
}
```

**Proof generation time:** ~30-60 seconds on consumer laptop

---

#### Step 3: Submit Proof to Smart Contract (On Midnight)

Alice submits to zkSalaria smart contract:

```javascript
Transaction to Midnight blockchain:
{
  function: "verify_credit_proof",
  proof: 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...,
  public_inputs: {
    txids: [0xTX001, 0xTX002, ...],
    merkle_root: 0xMerkleRoot123,
    threshold: 680,
    model_hash: 0xModelABC,
    employee_wallet: 0xAlice
  }
}
```

**What's on the blockchain:**
- ✅ Transaction IDs (public, verifiable)
- ✅ Merkle root (commitment to payment history)
- ✅ Threshold (what's being proven)
- ✅ Model hash (which model was used)
- ❌ NOT the actual credit score
- ❌ NOT the payment amounts
- ❌ NOT any private data

---

#### Step 4: Smart Contract Verification (Midnight Network)

The smart contract performs multiple verification steps:

```compact
export circuit verify_credit_proof(
  proof: Bytes<512>,
  employee_wallet: Bytes<32>,
  txids: Vector<6, Bytes<32>>,
  merkle_root: Bytes<32>,
  threshold: Uint<64>,
  model_hash: Bytes<32>
): Boolean {

  // ============================================
  // STEP 1: Verify transactions exist on-chain
  // ============================================
  for txid in txids {
    // Query Midnight blockchain
    const tx_exists = midnight_blockchain.transaction_exists(txid);
    assert(tx_exists, "Transaction doesn't exist");

    // Verify transaction was sent TO this employee
    const recipient = midnight_blockchain.get_recipient(txid);
    assert(recipient == employee_wallet, "Not your transaction");
  }

  // ============================================
  // STEP 2: Verify Merkle root
  // ============================================
  // This ensures the txids form a consistent set
  const computed_root = compute_merkle_root(txids);
  assert(computed_root == merkle_root, "Merkle root mismatch");

  // ============================================
  // STEP 3: Verify ZK proof
  // ============================================
  // This proves:
  // - ML model 0xModelABC was executed correctly
  // - Input was amounts decrypted from these specific txids
  // - Output exceeded threshold
  const proof_valid = midnight_verify_zkproof(
    proof,
    [txids, merkle_root, threshold, model_hash],
    verification_key_for_model_0xModelABC
  );

  assert(proof_valid, "ZK proof invalid");

  // ============================================
  // ALL CHECKS PASSED
  // ============================================
  // We now know cryptographically that:
  // ✓ Transactions exist on blockchain
  // ✓ Transactions were paid to this employee
  // ✓ ML model was run correctly
  // ✓ Input was from these specific blockchain payments
  // ✓ Output exceeded threshold

  // Store approval
  credit_approvals.insert(
    disclose(employee_wallet),
    disclose(threshold)
  );

  return true;
}
```

---

#### Step 5: Company/Lender Sees Result

**What the verifier (company offering advance) learns:**

✅ **Learns:**
- Alice proved her credit score > 680
- The proof is cryptographically valid
- The computation used real blockchain payments (txids verified)
- Alice is approved for the advance

❌ **Does NOT learn:**
- Alice's exact credit score (could be 681 or 850)
- Alice's actual salary amounts
- Any specific financial details
- Alice's spending patterns

**Company decision:**
```
Verification result: ✓ APPROVED
Alice qualifies for $2,000 advance

Company transfers $2,000 to Alice's wallet
Alice repays over 6 months
Company never learned her salary
```

---

## Two Trust Questions

### Question 1: "Did You Run the CORRECT MODEL?"

**Answer:** ✅ Cryptographically guaranteed by ZK-SNARK

#### How Model Integrity Works

**Setup (Done Once Per Model):**

1. **ML model is compiled to ZK circuit:**
   ```
   XGBoost Credit Model
   ↓ Export to ONNX
   ↓ Compile with EZKL
   ↓ Generate ZK Circuit

   Result:
   - Circuit with 50,000 constraints
   - Circuit hash: 0xModelABC
   - Verification key: 0xVerifyKey123
   ```

2. **Published publicly:**
   ```
   On Midnight blockchain:
   - Model Name: "zkSalaria Credit Scoring v1.0"
   - Model Hash: 0xModelABC
   - Verification Key: 0xVerifyKey123
   - Model Code: [link to GitHub]
   - Published: Nov 1, 2025
   ```

**Why you can't fake the model:**

```
Attack: Use a fake model that always returns high scores

def fake_model(anything):
    return 850  # Always high!

Try to generate proof:
↓
❌ FAILS at proof generation

Why?
- Verification key 0xVerifyKey123 is mathematically tied to
  the EXACT constraints of the real model

- Fake model doesn't match these constraints

- Can't generate valid proof that passes verification

- Cryptography prevents this attack
```

**The verification key ensures:**
- ✅ Exact model was used (can't substitute)
- ✅ All computations were correct (can't skip steps)
- ✅ No modifications were made (can't cheat)

**Technical guarantee:**
> If proof verifies with key 0xVerifyKey123, then model 0xModelABC was executed correctly. This is mathematically proven, not trusted.

---

### Question 2: "Did You Use REAL DATA as Input?"

**Answer:** ⚠️ Requires data provenance (binding to blockchain)

#### The Input Trust Problem

**What ZK proves:**
> "I ran model M on SOME inputs, output > threshold"

**What ZK does NOT prove:**
> "Those inputs were real payments from legitimate employment"

#### Example Attack (Without Data Binding):

```
Attacker creates fake payment history:

fake_payments = [$100,000, $100,000, $100,000, ...]  // FAKE!

Runs REAL model on FAKE data:
model(fake_payments) → score = 850

Generates ZK proof:
"My score > 680" (TRUE, but based on fake data!)

Submits proof:
Verifier checks: ✓ Proof valid
```

**Problem:** Model ran correctly, but on fabricated inputs!

This is the **BrickChain problem** - they hash documents but don't verify authenticity.

---

#### zkSalaria's Solution: Cryptographic Data Binding

**Our approach:** Tie ML inputs to blockchain transactions

```
Employee can ONLY generate proofs using:
- Real transaction IDs from Midnight blockchain
- Amounts decrypted with their private key
- Payments actually sent to their wallet

Can't use fake data because:
- Fake txids → on-chain verification fails
- Other people's txids → recipient check fails
- Wrong amounts → decryption proof fails
```

**This creates a chain of trust:**
```
Company Wallet (on-chain)
→ Signed Transaction (cryptographic signature)
→ Employee Wallet (on-chain)
→ Transaction ID (publicly verifiable)
→ Encrypted Amount (only employee can decrypt)
→ ML Model Input (bound to specific txid)
→ ZK Proof (proves computation on these specific inputs)
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Can't fake blockchain transactions (cryptographically impossible)
- ✅ Can't use someone else's transactions (recipient verification)
- ✅ Can't claim wrong amounts (decryption requires private key)
- ✅ Complete verifiable chain from payment to proof

---

## Cryptographic Binding: On-Chain to Off-Chain

### The Critical Question

> "How does on-chain verification match the off-chain ZKML proof?"

**Answer:** Merkle proofs + ZK circuit constraints

---

### Complete Technical Flow

#### Part 1: On-Chain Payment (Company → Employee)

```
Company pays Alice via zkSalaria:

Midnight Transaction:
{
  from: company_wallet_0xCompany,
  to: employee_wallet_0xAlice,
  amount: SHIELDED (encrypted),
  txid: 0xTX001,
  signature: signed_by_company,
  timestamp: Nov 1, 2025
}

On-chain state:
- Transaction 0xTX001 exists in Midnight blockchain ✓
- Recipient: 0xAlice ✓
- Amount: Encrypted (only Alice can decrypt with private key)
- Existence: Publicly verifiable by anyone
```

**Key properties:**
- Transaction ID (txid) is PUBLIC and verifiable
- Transaction existence is PUBLIC and verifiable
- Recipient address is PUBLIC and verifiable
- Amount is PRIVATE (shielded)

---

#### Part 2: Employee Builds Payment History (Off-Chain)

```
Alice's wallet queries Midnight blockchain:

Query: "Give me all transactions sent to wallet 0xAlice"

Blockchain returns:
[
  {txid: 0xTX001, from: 0xCompany, timestamp: Nov 1},
  {txid: 0xTX002, from: 0xCompany, timestamp: Oct 1},
  {txid: 0xTX003, from: 0xCompany, timestamp: Sep 1},
  {txid: 0xTX004, from: 0xCompany, timestamp: Aug 1},
  {txid: 0xTX005, from: 0xCompany, timestamp: Jul 1},
  {txid: 0xTX006, from: 0xCompany, timestamp: Jun 1}
]

Alice decrypts amounts using her private key:
- 0xTX001 → decrypt() → $7,500
- 0xTX002 → decrypt() → $7,500
- 0xTX003 → decrypt() → $7,200
- 0xTX004 → decrypt() → $7,800
- 0xTX005 → decrypt() → $7,500
- 0xTX006 → decrypt() → $7,500

Alice now has:
- Public data: Transaction IDs (verifiable on-chain)
- Private data: Amounts (only she knows)
```

---

#### Part 3: Create Merkle Tree (Binds Data to Blockchain)

```
Alice creates Merkle tree from transaction IDs:

                ROOT: 0xMerkleRoot123
                  /                    \
         Hash(TX001+TX002)         Hash(TX003+TX004)
            /         \                /          \
         TX001       TX002          TX003        TX004

                     ... (continues for TX005, TX006)

Merkle Root: 0xMerkleRoot123

This root is:
- Computed from on-chain transaction IDs
- Commits to a specific set of transactions
- Can be verified by anyone
- Changes if any txid is modified
```

**Merkle proof properties:**
- Binds together a specific set of transactions
- Can prove "txid X is in this set" efficiently
- Can't be faked (cryptographic hash function)
- Verifiable without revealing all transactions

**Optional (for extra security):**
```
Post Merkle root on-chain:

Alice's wallet state on Midnight:
{
  wallet: 0xAlice,
  payment_history_commitment: 0xMerkleRoot123,
  last_updated: Nov 1, 2025
}
```

---

#### Part 4: ML Model Runs on Amounts (Off-Chain)

```
ML Model input preparation:

payment_amounts = [7500, 7500, 7200, 7800, 7500, 7500]
                   ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑
                   |      |      |      |      |      |
              from TX001 TX002 TX003 TX004 TX005 TX006

ML Model execution:
Input: [7500, 7500, 7200, 7800, 7500, 7500]
↓ XGBoost Credit Scoring Model
↓
Output: credit_score = 745

Result stored privately (never revealed)
```

---

#### Part 5: Generate ZK Proof WITH Data Binding (Off-Chain)

**This is where the magic happens:**

```
ZK Circuit proves multiple statements simultaneously:

PRIVATE INPUTS (witness - never revealed):
- payment_amounts: [7500, 7500, 7200, 7800, 7500, 7500]
- ML model weights (thousands of parameters)
- Private key (to decrypt transaction amounts)
- Actual credit score: 745

PUBLIC INPUTS (verifiable by anyone):
- txids: [0xTX001, 0xTX002, 0xTX003, 0xTX004, 0xTX005, 0xTX006]
- merkle_root: 0xMerkleRoot123
- threshold: 680
- model_hash: 0xModelABC
- employee_wallet: 0xAlice

ZK CIRCUIT CONSTRAINTS (all must be satisfied):

Constraint 1: Merkle Proof
  "These txids produce merkle_root 0xMerkleRoot123"
  → Binds proof to specific transaction set

Constraint 2: Transaction Decryption
  "I decrypted amounts from these txids using my private key"
  → Proves access to actual payment data
  → Can't claim arbitrary amounts
  → Must use amounts from blockchain

Constraint 3: Model Execution
  "I ran ML model 0xModelABC on these amounts"
  → Proves correct model was used
  → Proves computation was correct
  → Can't substitute different model

Constraint 4: Threshold Check
  "The model output is > 680"
  → Proves the claim
  → Without revealing exact value

ALL FOUR CONSTRAINTS LINKED:
If ANY constraint fails → entire proof fails
Can't fake any part without breaking cryptography
```

**The proof cryptographically proves:**
```
"I have private key for wallet 0xAlice" AND
"Transactions [TX001...TX006] were sent to 0xAlice" AND
"I decrypted amounts from these transactions" AND
"These amounts form Merkle root 0xMerkleRoot123" AND
"I ran model 0xModelABC on these amounts" AND
"The output exceeded 680"

All without revealing:
- The amounts
- The exact score
- The private key
```

---

#### Part 6: On-Chain Verification (Midnight Smart Contract)

**Full verification process:**

```compact
export circuit verify_credit_proof(
  proof: Bytes<512>,
  employee_wallet: Bytes<32>,
  txids: Vector<6, Bytes<32>>,
  merkle_root: Bytes<32>,
  threshold: Uint<64>,
  model_hash: Bytes<32>
): Boolean {

  // =============================================
  // VERIFICATION STEP 1: Check Blockchain State
  // =============================================
  // Verify these transactions actually exist on Midnight

  for txid in txids {
    // Query blockchain: Does this transaction exist?
    const tx_exists = midnight_blockchain.transaction_exists(txid);
    assert(tx_exists, "Transaction not found on blockchain");

    // Query blockchain: Who received this payment?
    const recipient = midnight_blockchain.get_recipient(txid);
    assert(recipient == employee_wallet, "Transaction not sent to this wallet");

    // Query blockchain: Was this a valid payment transaction?
    const tx_type = midnight_blockchain.get_transaction_type(txid);
    assert(tx_type == "PAYMENT", "Not a payment transaction");
  }

  // If we reach here:
  // ✓ All transactions exist on blockchain
  // ✓ All were sent to this employee's wallet
  // ✓ All are legitimate payment transactions

  // =============================================
  // VERIFICATION STEP 2: Check Merkle Consistency
  // =============================================
  // Verify the txids form the claimed Merkle root

  const computed_merkle = compute_merkle_root(txids);
  assert(computed_merkle == merkle_root, "Merkle root doesn't match");

  // If we reach here:
  // ✓ The transaction set is consistent
  // ✓ No transactions were swapped or modified
  // ✓ This is the exact set used in computation

  // =============================================
  // VERIFICATION STEP 3: Verify ZK Proof
  // =============================================
  // This is the cryptographic verification

  const proof_valid = midnight_verify_zkproof(
    proof,                    // The ZK proof bytes
    [                         // Public inputs
      txids,
      merkle_root,
      threshold,
      model_hash,
      employee_wallet
    ],
    verification_key          // Key for model 0xModelABC
  );

  assert(proof_valid, "ZK proof verification failed");

  // If we reach here:
  // ✓ The proof is mathematically valid
  // ✓ Model 0xModelABC was executed correctly
  // ✓ Input was amounts from these specific transactions
  // ✓ Output exceeded threshold

  // =============================================
  // ALL VERIFICATIONS PASSED
  // =============================================

  // Store the approval
  credit_approvals.insert(
    disclose(employee_wallet),
    disclose({
      threshold: threshold,
      timestamp: current_timestamp(),
      txids_hash: merkle_root
    })
  );

  // Emit event
  emit CreditApproved(employee_wallet, threshold);

  return true;
}
```

**What was verified:**

✅ **On-chain verification:**
- Transactions exist on Midnight blockchain
- Transactions were sent to this specific employee
- Transactions are legitimate payments

✅ **Cryptographic verification:**
- Merkle proof ensures transaction set consistency
- ZK proof ensures correct model execution
- ZK proof binds computation to these specific transactions
- ZK proof proves output exceeded threshold

✅ **Complete chain of trust:**
- Company → Blockchain → Employee → ML Model → Proof → Verifier
- Every link is cryptographically secured
- No trust assumptions except blockchain consensus

## Why This Can't Be Faked

### Attack Scenarios and Why They Fail

#### Attack 1: "I'll Use Fake Transaction IDs"

```
Attacker strategy:
- Create fake txids: 0xFAKE001, 0xFAKE002, ...
- Generate ZK proof claiming high credit score
- Submit to smart contract

Execution:
↓ Submit proof with fake txids
↓ Smart contract runs verification

Verification Step 1:
for txid in [0xFAKE001, 0xFAKE002, ...] {
  tx_exists = blockchain.transaction_exists(txid);
  // Query Midnight blockchain...
}

Result:
❌ ATTACK FAILS

Why:
- Midnight blockchain doesn't have transactions with these IDs
- tx_exists returns FALSE
- Smart contract rejects proof immediately
- Attack stopped at Step 1, never reaches ZK verification
```

**Lesson:** Can't fake blockchain state. Transactions either exist or they don't.

---

#### Attack 2: "I'll Use Someone Else's Transactions"

```
Attacker strategy:
- Find rich person's wallet: 0xRichPerson
- Query their transactions: [0xRICH001, 0xRICH002, ...]
- These show high payments ($50,000/month)
- Generate ZK proof using their txids
- Claim these are MY payments

Execution:
↓ Submit proof with rich person's txids
↓ Smart contract runs verification

Verification Step 1:
for txid in [0xRICH001, 0xRICH002, ...] {
  tx_exists = blockchain.transaction_exists(txid);
  ✓ TRUE (these transactions exist)

  recipient = blockchain.get_recipient(txid);
  // Returns: 0xRichPerson

  assert(recipient == employee_wallet);
  // Checks: Does 0xRichPerson == 0xAttacker?
  // Answer: NO
}

Result:
❌ ATTACK FAILS

Why:
- Transactions exist (✓ pass Step 1a)
- But recipient is 0xRichPerson, not 0xAttacker
- Recipient check fails
- Smart contract rejects proof
- Can't claim other people's transactions
```

**Lesson:** Blockchain records WHO received each payment. Can't steal credit for someone else's income.

---

#### Attack 3: "I'll Create My Own Merkle Root"

```
Attacker strategy:
- Use real transactions that belong to me: [0xMY001, 0xMY002, ...]
- These are small payments ($500/month)
- Create FAKE Merkle root claiming different transactions
- Submit fake root: 0xFAKEROOT

Execution:
↓ Submit proof with fake Merkle root
↓ Smart contract runs verification

Verification Step 2:
computed_root = compute_merkle_root([0xMY001, 0xMY002, ...]);
// Smart contract recomputes root from actual txids
// Result: 0xREALROOT123

assert(computed_root == claimed_merkle_root);
// Checks: Does 0xREALROOT123 == 0xFAKEROOT?
// Answer: NO

Result:
❌ ATTACK FAILS

Why:
- Smart contract recomputes Merkle root from txids
- Attacker's fake root doesn't match
- Merkle mismatch detected
- Can't claim different transaction set than reality
```

**Lesson:** Merkle roots are deterministic. Can't claim a different root for the same transactions.

---

#### Attack 4: "I'll Fake the Transaction Amounts"

```
Attacker strategy:
- Use real txids that belong to me: [0xMY001, 0xMY002, ...]
- Real amounts: [$500, $500, $500, ...] (low income)
- In ML computation, CLAIM amounts are: [$7,500, $7,500, ...]
- Generate ZK proof with fake amounts

Execution:
↓ Try to generate ZK proof
↓ ZK circuit execution

ZK Circuit Constraint 2 (Transaction Decryption):
"I decrypted amounts from these txids using my private key"

Circuit computes:
amount[0] = decrypt(0xMY001, my_private_key)
// Decryption returns: $500 (real amount from blockchain)

Circuit checks:
assert(amount[0] == claimed_amount[0])
// Checks: Does $500 == $7,500?
// Answer: NO

Result:
❌ ATTACK FAILS at proof generation (never reaches verification)

Why:
- ZK circuit requires decrypting actual on-chain data
- Decryption is deterministic (private key → exact amount)
- Can't claim amounts different from blockchain
- Proof generation fails before submission
- Cryptography prevents this attack
```

**Lesson:** Can't fake encrypted data. Decryption with private key gives exact amount from blockchain.

---

#### Attack 5: "I'll Use a Different ML Model"

```
Attacker strategy:
- Use real transactions (low income: $500/month)
- Use FAKE ML model that always returns 850
- Generate proof claiming "my score > 680"

def fake_model(any_input):
    return 850  # Always high score!

Execution:
↓ Try to generate ZK proof using fake model
↓ ZK proof generation

Proof generation requires:
- Circuit for model 0xModelABC
- Verification key 0xVerifyKey123

Attacker's fake model:
- Different circuit (different constraints)
- Can't use verification key 0xVerifyKey123

Try to generate proof:
↓ Compute proof using fake model circuit
↓ Result: proof_bytes

Result:
❌ Proof generated, but...
❌ ATTACK FAILS at verification

Verification:
midnight_verify_zkproof(
  proof_bytes,              // From fake model
  verification_key          // For real model 0xModelABC
)
// Verification key 0xVerifyKey123 is mathematically tied
// to the EXACT constraints of the real model

// Fake model has different constraints
// Verification returns: FALSE

Why:
- Verification key is tied to specific circuit
- Different model = different circuit = different constraints
- Mathematical mismatch
- Cryptography detects the substitution
- Proof fails verification
```

**Lesson:** Verification key cryptographically binds to exact model. Can't substitute different computation.

---

#### Attack 6: "I'll Skip Some Computation Steps"

```
Attacker strategy:
- Use real model, but skip expensive steps
- Modify computation to give higher score
- Try to speed up proof generation

Modified model:
- Skip half the decision trees in XGBoost
- Returns inflated score

Execution:
↓ Try to generate proof with modified computation
↓ ZK circuit has 50,000 constraints

Each constraint represents ONE operation:
- Tree traversal
- Comparison
- Addition
- etc.

Modified computation:
- Only executes 25,000 operations (skipped half)
- Tries to generate proof

Result:
❌ ATTACK FAILS at proof generation

Why:
- ZK circuit has EXACT constraints for full computation
- All 50,000 constraints must be satisfied
- Skipping operations = some constraints unsatisfied
- Proof generation fails
- Can't generate valid proof without full computation
```

**Lesson:** ZK circuits enforce complete execution. Can't skip steps without proof failing.

### Summary: Cryptographic Guarantees

**The binding works because:**

1. **On-chain state is immutable**
   - Transactions on Midnight can't be faked
   - Blockchain consensus ensures integrity

2. **Merkle proofs are deterministic**
   - Same transactions → same Merkle root
   - Different transactions → different root
   - Can't claim different set

3. **Decryption is deterministic**
   - Private key + encrypted amount → exact value
   - Can't claim different amounts
   - Cryptography enforces this

4. **Verification keys are specific**
   - One model → one verification key
   - Different model → verification fails
   - Mathematical binding

5. **ZK circuits enforce completeness**
   - All constraints must be satisfied
   - Can't skip operations
   - Can't modify computation

**All five mechanisms together create an unbreakable chain:**
```
Blockchain State → Merkle Proof → Decryption → ML Computation → ZK Proof

If ANY link is broken → verification fails
Must be honest at EVERY step to generate valid proof
```

## Comparison to Traditional Systems

### Traditional Credit Check (Equifax/Experian)

**Trust Model:**
```
User → Sends data to Equifax → Equifax stores in database
                ↓
        Equifax claims: "This is accurate"
                ↓
        Lender trusts Equifax
```

**Trust Assumptions:**
- Trust Equifax's database (centralized)
- Trust they weren't hacked (they were - 147M records in 2017)
- Trust they have correct data (they don't - error rate ~20%)
- Trust they protect privacy (they don't - sell to advertisers)
- Trust they won't leak data (constant breaches)

**No Cryptographic Guarantees:**
- ❌ Can't verify computation was correct
- ❌ Can't verify data is real
- ❌ Can't verify privacy is maintained
- ❌ Just trust the company

**Privacy:**
- ❌ Equifax sees all your financial data
- ❌ Data stored forever in centralized database
- ❌ Sold to third parties
- ❌ Breaches expose everything

### zkSalaria Credit Check

**Trust Model:**
```
Blockchain Payments → Employee computes locally → Generates ZK proof
                                    ↓
                    Smart contract verifies cryptographically
                                    ↓
                    Lender trusts: Math + Blockchain
```

**Trust Assumptions:**
- Trust blockchain consensus (decentralized, 1000s of validators)
- Trust cryptography (peer-reviewed, mathematically proven)
- Trust open-source code (auditable by anyone)

**Cryptographic Guarantees:**
- ✅ Computation verified by ZK-SNARK (math)
- ✅ Data verified by blockchain (consensus)
- ✅ Model verified by verification key (cryptography)
- ✅ Privacy guaranteed by zero-knowledge property

**Privacy:**
- ✅ Computation happens locally (data never leaves device)
- ✅ Only proof is shared (zero knowledge)
- ✅ No centralized database
- ✅ Employee controls disclosure

## Technical Implementation Details

### ZKML Stack

**Model Training:**
```python
# Python - Train credit scoring model
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load training data (historical credit scores + payment patterns)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_credit_data()

# Train XGBoost model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=1000,      # 1000 decision trees
    max_depth=8,            # Max tree depth
    learning_rate=0.1,
    objective='binary:logistic'
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")  # Target: >80%
```

**Model Export:**
```python
# Export to ONNX format (standardized ML model format)
from skl2onnx import convert_sklearn
from skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType

# Define input shape
initial_type = [('float_input', FloatTensorType([None, 6]))]

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model = convert_sklearn(
    model,
    initial_types=initial_type,
    target_opset=12
)

# Save to file
with open("credit_model.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(onnx_model.SerializeToString())
```

**ZK Circuit Generation:**
```bash
# EZKL - Convert ONNX model to ZK circuit

# Step 1: Generate settings
ezkl gen-settings \
  --model credit_model.onnx \
  --settings settings.json

# Step 2: Compile to circuit
ezkl compile-circuit \
  --model credit_model.onnx \
  --compiled-circuit circuit.compiled \
  --settings settings.json

# Step 3: Setup (generate proving/verification keys)
ezkl setup \
  --compiled-circuit circuit.compiled \
  --params-path params.bin \
  --vk-path verification_key.bin \
  --pk-path proving_key.bin

# Step 4: Generate model hash
ezkl get-hash \
  --compiled-circuit circuit.compiled
# Output: 0xModelABC... (publish this on-chain)
```

**Proof Generation (Runtime):**
```python
# Python - Generate proof for user

import ezkl
import json

# User's private payment data
payment_amounts = [7500, 7500, 7200, 7800, 7500, 7500]
txids = ['0xTX001', '0xTX002', '0xTX003', '0xTX004', '0xTX005', '0xTX006']

# Create witness (private inputs)
witness = {
    'input_data': payment_amounts,
    'private_key': user_private_key  # For decryption proof
}

# Save witness
with open('witness.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(witness, f)

# Generate proof
proof = ezkl.prove(
    witness='witness.json',
    model='credit_model.onnx',
    pk_path='proving_key.bin',
    proof_path='proof.json',
    settings='settings.json'
)

# Proof generation takes ~30-60 seconds
print(f"Proof generated: {proof}")

# Read proof
with open('proof.json', 'r') as f:
    proof_data = json.load(f)

# Submit to blockchain
submit_to_midnight(
    proof=proof_data,
    txids=txids,
    threshold=680
)
```
